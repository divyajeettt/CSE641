# CSE641: Deep Learning

## About CSE641

**[CSE641: *Deep Learning*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=ECE553)** is a 6xx-level course offered to undergrads pursuing the CSAI and ECE disciplines at IIIT-Delhi. The course introduces students to the basic techniques of deep learning with mathematical rigour. This hands-on course aims to enable students to:

- design intelligent Deep Learning systems to solve real-world problems
- understand various Deep Learning models like [ANNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), [CNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network), [RNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network), [Autoencoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder), etc.
- analyze various applications solved through the use of deep learning models
